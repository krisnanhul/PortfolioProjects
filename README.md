 **How to Detect Credit Card Fraud with R programming**

The goal of the project is to use various tools via the R program to detect credit card fraudulent transactions. Statistical algorithms used during the process are Logistic Regression Models, ROC Curve, Decision Tree Algorithms, Artificial Neural Network, and the Gradient Boosting Model to classify and distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions.

**The Dataset Used**

The credit card dataset used for this project was provided by [Fraud Detection Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CTAlmlREFRaEN3NoHHitewpqAtWS5cVQ/view) .

**Summary**

I've learned how to develop a credit card fraud detection model using different machine learning options to tackle and predict credit card fraud.
Different algorithms were used to plot models and curves of the dataset provided. I also analyzed and visualized the dataset to determine fraudulent credit card transactions.
